==============

Derive macro for [prototk::Message](https://docs.rs/prototk/latest/prototk/trait.Message.html).

Status

Maintenance track.  The library is considered stable and will be put into maintenance mode if unchanged for one year.

Scope
-----

prototk_derive will provide a derive macro for Message, as well as all `prototk` auxilliary traits.

Warts
-----

- It would be nice to use the [derive_util](https://crates.io/crates/derive_util) crate.

Documentation
-------------

The latest documentation is always available at [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/prototk_derive/latest/prototk_derive/).

Updating
--------

- 0.2.1 -> 0.3.0:  User facing changes only enable behavior.  No action necessary.
