TextTale
========

TextTale provides tools for writing text-mode adventures.

Status
------

Active development.  TextTale is likely to change in the near future in backwards-incompatible ways.  No changes are
planned, but the library is immature.

Scope
-----

Macros and functions for telling stories.  TextTale makes it easy to write a story that can be run interactively and
then replayed.  See the `scripts/` folder and `src/bin/texttale.rs` for an example.
