=======

busybee provides synchronous/thread-pool implementations of rpc_pb.

Status
------

Active development.  Busybee is likely to change in the near future in backwards-incompatible ways.  Planned changes
will affect how errors are handled.  Currently they are not well-handled.  This library is currently beta at best.

Scope
-----

busyrpc will provide the RPC for client and server to glue rpc_pb types to the wire.
